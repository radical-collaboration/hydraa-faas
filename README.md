# FaaS Support for the HYDRAA Resource Broker

This is the internship project (sponsored by the 
[DOE SULI](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) program), which is focused on 
the design and development of FaaS capabilities for the HYDRAA[^1] resource 
broker (HPC+Cloud) to support the execution of functions on cloud resources (as 
part of the [RADICAL-DREAM](https://github.com/radical-project/radical.dream) 
project).
